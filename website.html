            A smart home refers to a residence equipped with a communication network, high-tech household devices, appliances, and sensors that can be remotely accessed, monitored, and controlled and that provide services responding to the residents' needs. Although the widespread diffusion of high-speed Internet in the late 1990s provided the opportunity for the home network business to grow, it was not until the late 2000s that smart homes began to be installed, which is when smart phones were popularized. Initially, a smart home was defined using various names, such as a home network, a digital home, home automation, and an intelligent home. In the mid-2010s, it has been leaning towards a combination of Internet of Things (IoT) and a situation-aware smart home.


            However, this technology is not constrained just to our homes. It’s growing in terms of both scope and capabilities. Enter the smart city, where the Internet of Things will impact everything from lighting to the flow of traffic through urban centres.
The IEEE Standards Association says of Smart Cities: “As world urbanization continues to grow and the total population expected to double by 2050, there exists an increased demand for intelligent, sustainable environments that reduce environmental impact and over citizens a high-quality life. A smart city brings together technology, government and society to enable a smart economy, smart mobility, a smart environment, smart people, smart living and smart governance.”

            Introduction: 
            The term “Internet of Things” was coined by entrepreneur Kevin Ashton, one of the founders of the Auto-ID Center at MIT. Ashton was part of a team that discovered how to link objects to the internet through an RFID tag. He first used the phrase “Internet of Things” in a 1999 presentation – and it has stuck around ever since.
            The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that enables the communication between electronic devices and sensors through the internet in order to facilitate our lives. IoT use smart devices and internet to provide innovative solutions to various challenges and issues related to various business, governmental and public/private industries across the world. IoT is progressively becoming an important aspect of our life that can be sensed everywhere around us. In whole, IoT is an innovation that puts together extensive variety of smart systems, frameworks and intelligent devices and sensors. Moreover, it takes advantage of quantum and nanotechnology in terms of storage, sensing and processing speed which were not conceivable beforehand. Extensive research studies have been done and available in terms of scientific articles, press reports both on internet and in the form of printed materials to illustrate the potential effectiveness and applicability of IoT transformations. It could be utilized as a preparatory work before making novel innovative business plans while considering the security, assurance and interoperability.
            A great transformation can be observed in our daily routine life along with the increasing involvement of IoT devices and technology. One such development of IoT is the concept of Smart Home Systems (SHS) and appliances that consist of internet-based devices, automation system for homes and reliable energy management system. Besides, another important achievement of IoT is Smart Health Sensing system (SHSS). SHSS incorporates small intelligent equipment and devices to support the health of the human being. These devices can be used both indoors and outdoors to check and monitor the different health issues and fitness level or the number of calories burned in the fitness centre etc. Also, it is being used to monitor the critical health conditions in the hospitals and trauma centres as well. Hence, it has changed the entire scenario of the medical domain by facilitating it with high technology and smart devices. Moreover, IoT developers and researchers are actively involved to uplift the life style of the disabled and senior age group people. IoT has shown a drastic performance in this area and has provided a new direction for the normal life of such people. As these devices and equipment are very cost effective in terms of development cost and easily available within a normal price range, hence most of the people are availing them. Thanks to IoT, as they can live a normal life. Another important aspect of our life is transportation. IoT has brought up some new advancements to make it more efficient, comfortable and reliable. Intelligent sensors, drone devices are now controlling the traffic at different signalized intersections across major cities. In addition, vehicles are being launched in markets with pre-installed sensing devices that are able to sense the upcoming heavy traffic congestions on the map and may suggest you another route with low traffic congestion. Therefore, IoT has a lot to serve in various aspects of life and technology. We may conclude that IoT has a lot of scope both in terms of technology enhancement and facilitate the humankind.

            Implementation OF iot in smart homes
            Smart homes are one of the trendy application areas of IoT that incorporates smart cities as well. Smart home consists of IoT enabled home appliances, air-conditioning/heating system, television, audio/video streaming devices, and security systems which are communicating with each other in order to provide best comfort, security and reduced energy consumption. All this communication takes place through IoT based central control unit using Internet. The concept of smart city gained popularity in the last decade and attracted a lot of research activities. The smart home business economy is about to cross the 100 billion dollars by 2022. Smart home does not only provide the in-house comfort but also benefits the house owner in cost cutting in several aspects i.e., low energy consumption will result in comparatively lower electricity bill. Besides smart homes, another category that comes within smart city is smart vehicles. Modern cars are equipped with intelligent devices and sensors that control most of the components from the headlights of the car to the engine. The IoT is committed towards developing a new smart car system that incorporates wireless communication between car-to-car and car-to-driver to ensure predictive maintenance with comfortable and safe driving experience. The concept of connected devices – particularly connected machines – has been around for a long time. For example, machines have been communicating with each other since the first electric telegraphs were developed in the late 1830s. Other technologies that fed into IoT were radio voice transmissions, wireless (Wi-Fi) technologies and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software. Then in 1982, a modified Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University became the first connected smart appliance. Using the university’s local ethernet or ARPANET – a precursor to today’s internet – students could find out which drinks were stocked, and whether they were cold.
            There are several important functional blocks responsible for I/O operations, connectivity issues, processing, audio/video monitoring and storage management. All this functional block together incorporates an efficient IoT system which are important for optimum performance. Although, there are several reference architectures proposed with the technical specifications, but these are still far from the standard architecture that is suitable for global IoT. Therefore, a suitable architecture is still needing to be designed that could satisfy the global IoT needs. The generic working structure of IoT system shows a dependency of IoT on particular application parameters. IoT gateways have an important role in IoT communication as it allows connectivity between IoT servers and IoT devices related to several applications.

            How IoT in Smart Home Works?
The home can be called smart when it has a range of smart devices that you can control remotely by setting them the way you like to automatize house maintenance. They can also be united into one network. For example, the lights can turn on at the moment you enter the home (lamps will know it from the sensors) or your vacuum cleaner can start cleaning every day at 11 AM.
Most of the IoT based Home Automation systems available today work on three widely used wireless communication protocols: Wi-Fi, ZigBee and Z-Wave. The ZigBee and the Z-Wave controllers are assigned a network ID which is distributed over other sensors in the network. The communication amongst devices take place in a mesh topology where there is no fixed path for the signals transmitted from the controller to the sensors and vice versa. Depending on the availability of the shortest path the signal from the controller will travel to the target sensors either directly or through signal hops. If any intermediate sensor in the pathway is busy or occupied the signal will trace another path within the mesh network to reach the final destination. Note that sensors with different Network IDs cannot communicate with each other over common channel. Mesh networks offer great advantages for IoT in the business world. They allow larger-scale deployments to be achieved easier and cheaper than regular networking models. But things are different in the smart home.
Simply put, a mesh network is a network where, instead of each device connecting to a central hub (router, smartphone etc.), each device becomes a node in an interconnected web of devices. Each node communicates with many or all nodes nearby and, eventually, the network connects to a gateway to the Internet. In this way, data has many different potential routes around the network.

    <p style="font-family: serif;" id="local7">
            But the true magic starts when IoT (Internet of Things) joins this team. It provides all the devices with internet access which broadens the possibilities of such a home network. For instance, now you can see what happens in your house watching security cameras through your smartphone or computer. IoT applications allow you connecting devices to each other and letting them communicate without your participation. Imagine this: the moment your car leaves the parking near the office, the conditioner starts cooling your house so that after a hot day you could enter a pleasantly cool home.
Scalability, modularity, interoperability and openness are the key design issues for an efficient IoT architecture in a heterogenous environment. The IoT architecture must be designed with an objective to fulfil the requirements of cross domain interactions, multi-system integration with the potential of simple and scalable management functionalities, big data analytics and storage, and user-friendly applications. Also, the architecture should be able to scaleup the functionality and add some intelligence and automation among the IoT devices in the system

    <p style="font-family: serif;" id="local8">
            Noura et al. stated the importance of interoperability in IoT as it allows integration of devices, services from different heterogeneous platforms to provide the efficient and reliable service. Several other studies focused on the importance of interoperability and discussed several challenges that interoperability issue is facing in IoT. Kim et al. addressed the issue of climate change and proposed an IoT based ecological monitoring system. They mentioned that existing approaches are time consuming and required a lot of human intervention. Also, a routine visit is required to collect the information from the sensors installed at the site under investigation. Also, some information remained missing which leads to not highly accurate analysis. Therefore, IoT based framework is able to solve this problem and can provide high accuracy in analysis and prediction. Later, Wang et al. shows their concern for domestic waste water treatment. They discussed several deficiencies in the process of waste water treatment and dynamic monitoring system and suggested effective solutions based on IoT. They stated that IoT can be very effective in the waste water treatment and process monitoring

            APPLICATION
The Hi-Tech world is currently growing and can bring a lot of opportunities for businesses, and IoT for smart homes is no exception. Many world-famous companies have already created great products and solutions. August smart lock has the reputation of the most reliable one, just like Nest’s thermostat is considered to be the best solution for adjusting the climate of one’s home. Smart home assistants are also in high demand right now. For example, Google Home or Amazon’s Alexa helps to manage smart devices reacting to your voice commands.
At first glance, the rush towards IoT adoption seems to be one of convenience, similar to the use of smart technology within a home. For instance, no one really needs a refrigerator that can reorder groceries when the on-hand supply gets low. It’s convenience. The same concept does not apply to the integration of smart technology within city infrastructure. Here, it’s more about achieving important goals, such as improving the use life and management of infrastructure, enhancing resident safety, and cutting costs and energy usage to be greener. To really understand the rise of smart cities, we need to delve into some of the drivers behind the adoption of this technology.
