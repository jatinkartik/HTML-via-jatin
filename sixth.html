        If you think your personal <i>information</i> is secure, think again. Keeping your information safe is now the exception, 
        not the rule. According to a recent Pew Research Center study, an <em>astounding</em> 64% of Americans have had their personal 
        information exposed by a data breach of some kind.
        
        Of this group:
        
        41% experienced fraudulent credit card charges.
        35% had important information (such as an account number) compromised.
        16% had their email accounts hacked.
        13% had someone else take control of their social media account.
        15% had their Social Security number revealed.
        14% had someone try to take out lines of credit or loans in their name.
        6% had an impostor file fraudulent tax returns under their name.
        Unfortunately, there are unscrupulous people on the Internet who are looking to take advantage of you. 
        As such, itâ€™s important to learn what kinds of information these individuals are looking for and how they can use your data to harm you.
        More importantly, you need to know how to protect yourself by guarding your information online.

    <h2> Use two factor authentication to add more <abbr title=" guide to stay secure in new era"><mark>security</mark></abbr> layer to you accounts</h2>
    <img src="F:\work image\acastro_200214_3900_browser_package_0001.0.webp" width="1000" height="600">
        <pre  style="font-size: x-large;" id="local2"> Just about any account you own on the internet is prone to being hacked. After numerous widespread breaches
             through the past few years, tech companies have been working together to develop a standard that would make 
             passwords a thing of the past, replacing them with more secure methods like biometric or PIN-based logins that
              do not require transferring data over the internet.

            But while those standards are still being adopted, the next best way to secure your accounts is two-factor 
            authentication, or 2FA. This a process that gives web services secondary access to the account owner (you) in 
            order to verify a login attempt. Typically, this involves a phone number and / or email address. This is how it 
            you log in to a service, you use your mobile phone to verify your identity by either clicking on a texted / emailed link 
             a number sent by an authenticator app.</pre>
    <h3>Never use this type of password mention below</h3>
    <img src="F:\work image\download.jpg" width="1000" height="600">
    <pre id="local3" style="font: x-large;">
        a minimum of 1 lower case letter [a-z] and
a minimum of 1 upper case letter [A-Z] and
a minimum of 1 numeric character [0-9] and
a minimum of 1 special character: ~`!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\;:"<>,./?
at least 1 upper case, numeric, and special character must be EMBEDDED somewhere in the middle of the password, and not just be the first or the last character of the password string.
Passwords must be at least 10 characters in length, but can be much longer.
Passphrases are longer versions of passwords that may be easier to remember and harder to guess. If you opt to use a passphrase, some of the complexity requirements are relaxed:

a minimum of 20 characters in length
a minimum of 2 character sets from these classes: [letters], [numbers], [special characters (as above)]
Some other considerations:

Please do not use the same password in the CS Department that you use anywhere else -- either in the rest of the University, at other jobs, other research institutions, etc.
Never tell *anyone* else your password.
Don't write your password down, and especially don't post in your work area, or online in a file.
Passwords must not be based on a dictionary word or have been previously cracked.
Passwords should not contain any personal information.  <a href="https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/10-ways-to-keep-your-information-safe-in-the-digital-age-02130163" target="_blank" title="bussiness.com"> read more</a>
